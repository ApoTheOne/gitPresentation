### Markdown
##### What?
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)

##### Why?

Markdown == FAST && EASY

HTML's start and closing tags  
 vs  
Simple text

Let's try it out  
Use ```*bold*``` to make text **bold**.
Use ```*italic*``` for *italic*.

Use numbers, *, or - to create lists.
