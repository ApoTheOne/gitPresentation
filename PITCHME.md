What is GitPitch?  
GitPitch is a markdown presentation service for everyone on Git. You can use it to promote, pitch or present absolutely anything using the tools you already know and love - Markdown + Git.

---
The service introduces a new convention for Git users, called PITCHME.md. The GitPitch server turns PITCHME.md markdown files found within any public or private repo into online and offline, interactive slideshows.

---
Is GitPitch for you?
If you ever find yourself needing to present a concept, design, library, framework, product, service, training materials, or educational course work:  

- To colleagues, clients or customers 
- At meetups or conferences 
- At training events or teaching sessions 

---

Then GitPitch is for you. 

Simply capture your ideas in Markdown and let GitPitch automatically turn those ideas into compelling, responsive, online and offline slideshow presentations.

---
How does GitPitch work?  
GitPitch presentations are powered by the amazing reveal.js presentation framework. But with GitPitch there is nothing to download. Nothing to install. All you need is your favorite text editor. And an account on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Or a self-hosted instance of GitHub Enterprise, GitLab CE, GitBucket, Gitea, or Gogs.

---

```
git add PITCHME.md
git commit -m "My first presentation"
git push
```

#### What is Markdown?
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.  
Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)

---

#### Why?

Markdown == FAST && EASY

HTML's start and closing tags  
 vs  
Simple text

---
Let's try it out  
Use ```**bold**``` to make text **bold**.  
Use ```*italic*``` for *italic*.

Use numbers, *, or - to create lists.
* First |
* Second |
* Third |
* Fourth |
